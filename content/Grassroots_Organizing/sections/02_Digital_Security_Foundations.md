# Digital Security Foundations

## Introduction: Digital Security as a Survival Imperative

In an era where grassroots organizing is inextricably tied to digital spaces, robust digital security is not merely a precaution — it is the cornerstone of organizational survival. The shift to online platforms for messaging, strategic planning, and data sharing has exponentially increased exposure to state-sponsored surveillance, sophisticated cyberattacks, and coordinated harassment campaigns. Compromised security risks more than operational disruption: it endangers lives through physical retaliation, doxxing, and targeted arrests. This section provides a tactical framework to fortify your organization’s digital defenses, ensuring resilience against evolving threats while enabling safe, sustained activism.

## Threat Landscape: The Invisible War on Grassroots Movements

Grassroots organizers operate in a high-stakes environment where adversaries exploit both technology and human vulnerability.

### Key Threats Include:

- **State Surveillance:**
  - Device infiltration via NSO Group-style spyware or compromised apps.
  - Legal coercion (e.g., subpoenas to Meta/Google for user data).

- **Far-Right Targeting:**
  - Doxxing networks weaponizing personal data to incite harassment.
  - Phishing traps disguised as ally communications.

- **Corporate Espionage:**
  - Data brokers selling activist metadata to union-busting firms or fossil fuel lobbyists.

- **Social Engineering:**
  - Deepfake audio impersonating leaders.
  - Fake "emergency" alerts designed to trigger panic.

> **Core Principle:** Operate under the assumption that all digital activity is monitored. **Proactive defense is survival.**

## Personal Device Security: Fortify Your Frontlines

Devices are the **weakest link** in most breaches. Lock them down relentlessly.

### Non-Negotiable Protocols:

- **Full-Disk Encryption:** Mandatory for ALL devices.
  - Tools: BitLocker (Windows), FileVault (Mac), LUKS (Linux).
  - Why: Renders data unreadable if devices are seized.

- **Dedicated Work Devices:**
  - Never mix activism with personal browsing.

- **Purge Spyware Risks:**
  - Delete non-essential apps (e.g., Facebook, TikTok). 
  - Disable location services.

- **Biometric Ban:**
  - Use 20+ character passwords or alphanumeric passcodes — **never use biometrics**.

- **Updates as Armor:**
  - Enable auto-updates for OS/apps to patch zero-day exploits.

## Encrypted Email & Secure Accounts: Burn Your Digital Fingerprints

### Secure Email Providers:

- **ProtonMail**: Zero-access encryption, based in Switzerland.
- **Tutanota**: Open-source, GDPR-compliant, encrypted calendars.

### Account Setup Rules:

- **No Real Names** — use pseudonyms unlinked to personal history.
- **Tor-Created Accounts** to mask IPs during signup.
- **2FA or Die:**
  - Use **Aegis Authenticator** (open-source).
  - **Avoid** SMS-based 2FA (vulnerable to SIM-swapping).
- **Password Hygiene:** 
  - Use **KeePassXC (offline)**, never reuse passwords.

## VPNs, Tor, and Anonymous Browsing: Disappear from the Grid

### Tool Strategy:

- **VPNs:**
  - Use: **Mullvad (cash payments accepted)**, **ProtonVPN**.
  - Avoid free VPNs — they **sell your data**.

- **Tor Browser:** 
  - Use for whistleblowing, leaks, high-risk sources.

- **Brave Browser:** 
  - Block trackers for general research.
  - **Never** log into organizing accounts here.

## Operational Security (OpSec): The Art of Invisibility

Tools mean nothing without behavioral rigor. **OpSec is survival.**

### OpSec Commandments:

- **No Leaks:**
  - Ban sensitive discussions on SMS, WhatsApp, Discord.
  - Use **Signal (disappearing messages on)**.

- **Compartmentalize:**
  - Share intel only on a need-to-know basis.

- **Burner Layers:**
  - Use prepaid phones, **Tails OS USB drives** for high-risk ops.

- **Zero Cloud Traces:**
  - Store files in **Veracrypt containers**, not Google Drive.

---

## Hardware & Software: Tools of the Resistance

### Device Hierarchy:

- **Low Risk:** Standard laptops (encrypted).
- **High Risk:**
  - **Purism Librem Laptops** (hardware kill switches).
  - **GrapheneOS Phones** (de-Googled, hardened).

### Software Arsenal:

- **Collaboration:** CryptPad (encrypted).
- **Storage:** NextCloud (self-hosted).
- **Comms:** Session (anonymous, no phone number).

---

## Ongoing Training: Security as a Living Culture

### Maintenance Rituals:

- **Monthly Threat Briefings:** Update on new exploits (e.g., Pegasus variants).
- **Phishing Fire Drills:** Simulated attacks to test alertness.
- **Digital Security SWAT Team:** 
  - Audits, protocol enforcement, incident response.
- **Routine Software Updates:** Across all devices/apps.

## Conclusion: Security as Sustained Resistance

Digital security is the **oxygen supply for modern activism**. In a world where repressive regimes and corporate giants wield digital weapons, **your protocols determine whether your movement survives**. Embedding these practices into organizational DNA creates **a shield against attacks** and a foundation for **uncompromising, long-term resistance**.

> **Survive. Adapt. Outmaneuver.**
