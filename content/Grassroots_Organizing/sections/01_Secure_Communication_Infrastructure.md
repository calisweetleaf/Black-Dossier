# 01 Secure Communication Infrastructure

The most critical and foundational priority of any grassroots organization is to establish a secure communications infrastructure. Without stringently encrypted communications and strictly enforced protocols, groups will be susceptible to being targeted by infiltration, pervasive spying, and orchestrated disruption – attacks that can decimate operations and put individuals at risk. This chapter provides an end-to-end blueprint of key principles, advanced cryptography, and operational best practices to establish a privacy-focused and resilient communications system. This kind of ecosystem preserves member anonymity, maintains the integrity of sensitive data, and keeps confidential data secure while enabling secure, real-time collaboration. By prioritizing these measures, organizations can minimize external and internal threats, establish member trust, and maintain the momentum necessary to execute their mission – even in hostile environments.

Whereas modern encryption technologies are required, they are only as good as the people working with them. A good system of secure communication is built as much on discipline and trust as on tech. Members must understand that a misstep in following security practices — even a minor one — can put the whole collective under watch, under attack, or worse. Enforcing rigorous operational security (OpSec) practices is not a choice: compartmentalizing sensitive information, keeping to a minimum who knows what, pseudonyms, and disconnecting from real-world identities are required to keep things safe. Organizers must also resist the temptation to use convenient but insecure tools, such as SMS, Facebook Messenger, Discord, or plain old email, for any work pertaining to organizing — no matter how convenient.

Grassroots organizations are faced with a range of threats from a variety of opponents: state surveillance by law enforcement and intelligence forces, corporate espionage against activists, and far-right extremism trying to sabotage movements from the inside. These opponents have sophisticated methods, including the collection of metadata, intercepting unencrypted communications, impersonation by trusted individuals, and phishing attacks to gain access to devices and confidential conversations. Organizations must work under the presumption that they are already under surveillance — and that any weak point in their communications system will be exploited.

In order to address these threats, all communication needs to be end-to-end (E2EE) encrypted so that only the targeted recipients can read the messages — and even the providers have no access to content. The most highly recommended tools to use for secure messaging are Signal and Session for one-to-one and group messaging. They have strong encryption with minimal exposure to metadata and include advanced features like disappearing messages and verification of identities. To address decentralized and scalable communication needs, Matrix with Element provides a federated, end-to-end-encrypted chatting system that can be self-hosted to have full control and privacy. These systems have to be the foundation of daily communication channels for any grassroots movement.
In-person meetups or video calls require special precautions. Video and voice calls should be made on end-to-end-encrypted, open-source software such as Jitsi Meet — better still, self-hosted on a secure server. Members should regard video calls as high-risk environments: microphones and cameras are potential means of spying, and groups should be vigilant against impersonation, especially when adding new individuals to conversations. To provide an added layer of protection, groups should also switch off video when not necessary and use voice-only where feasible.

Besides platforms and applications, the most important element of a safe communication system is the norms and protocols that are established and followed within the community. These protocols should have:

    Stringent member verification procedures, including the use of in-app security codes and out-of-band verification to prevent impersonation.
    The use of disappearing messages to have sensitive conversations to reduce the likelihood of exposure if devices are compromised.
    No cloud storage of messaging applications to prevent third parties from obtaining access to message logs.
    Clear directives that no organization-related communication should take place outside approved secure media.
    Compartmentalisation, where only the persons immediately involved in a particular action or work are given the information, and broader awareness regarding operations is kept to a minimum.

Secure file sharing and document collaboration are just as critical. Organizations must avoid corporate applications and tools like Google Docs, Dropbox, and others lacking real privacy protection. They must instead adopt applications that are encrypted, including CryptPad, Skiff, and NextCloud (self-hosted), to work with documents, planning, and sensitive content. Where feasible, groups must use file-sharing services that are encrypted, including OnionShare, which allows anonymous file transfer over Tor.

Just as critical as the tools themselves is member training. Current and new members need to be provided with regular workshops on the use of secure messaging apps, how to spot phishing attacks, and how to practice good digital hygiene, such as device security and safe browsing habits. Members need to have their awareness and response exercised by conducting simulated attacks, such as impersonation attacks or phishing emails, on a routine basis. Finally, a secure communications infrastructure must be reviewed and upgraded regularly. Platforms and tools evolve, but so do threats. Organizations must scan their tools and practices every so often, updating or replacing compromised or antiquated applications. An explicit department or role responsible for communications security, just as there is an "internal security" unit, can assist to keep and enforce these standards in the long term. Secure communication is not an initial setup but a living system that must evolve as the organization grows and as opponents become more sophisticated. Without it, no grassroots movement will survive long enough to achieve its goals.
